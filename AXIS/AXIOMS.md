# AXIS: Foundational Axioms

**Status: FROZEN**

These axioms form the irreducible foundation of the Entity Characterization Framework.

---

## A1: Entity Axiom

> **An entity is a difference that maintains itself and makes a difference.**

- "difference that maintains itself" → persistence, identity over time
- "makes a difference" → has causal efficacy, is not epiphenomenal

**Corollary**: If it doesn't persist or doesn't make a difference, it's not an entity for ECF purposes.

---

## A2: Configuration Axiom

> **Every entity E has a configuration Config(E) = { C, S, Σ, K, R, U }**

| Symbol | Name | Type | Meaning |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| C | Closure | [0,1] | Degree of self-production |
| S | Scope | [0,∞) | Extent of relevance field |
| Σ | Strata | Set | Which strata E participates in |
| K | Capabilities | Set | Active capabilities |
| R | Relations | Graph | Connections to other entities |
| U | Uncertainty | [0,1] | Confidence in characterization |

---

## A3: Closure-Scope Trade-off

> **High Closure (C) and high Scope (S) create tension.**

- High C → tight boundaries → less external influence → more autonomous
- High S → broad field → more interdependence → less autonomous

This is not a law but a tendency. Some entities achieve both through nested structure.

---

## A4: Stratal Nesting

> **Higher strata presuppose and include lower strata.**

```
LOGOS ⊃ SENTIENCE ⊃ LIFE ⊃ MATTER
```

A LOGOS entity (human) is also:
- Material (has physical substrate)
- Living (metabolizes, reproduces)
- Sentient (feels, evaluates)

---

## A5: Capability Emergence

> **Each stratum enables new capabilities.**

| Stratum | New Capabilities |
|---------|------------------|
| MATTER | Persist |
| LIFE | Self-produce |
| SENTIENCE | Feel, Evaluate |
| LOGOS | Represent, Norm |

Capabilities are cumulative. A LOGOS entity has all six capabilities.

---

## A6: Geometric Completeness

> **Any entity can be fully characterized through the six geometries.**

The geometries (Distinction, Transformation, Inclusion, Connection, Reflexion, Quality) are:
- **Complete**: No aspect of an entity escapes them
- **Orthogonal**: Each captures something the others don't
- **Universal**: Apply to all entities regardless of stratum

---

## A7: Observer Entanglement

> **Characterization depends on observer perspective.**

- The observer is also an entity with Config(Observer)
- Observer's stratum limits what they can perceive (MATTER can't perceive LOGOS features)
- Observer's scope limits what they can attend to
- Characterization is always partial

**Corollary**: Atlas characterizing itself requires acknowledgment of this reflexive limitation.

---

## A8: Boundary Constructivism

> **Boundaries are drawn, not found.**

Entity boundaries are:
- Pragmatically useful rather than ontologically given
- Dependent on the question being asked
- Often contested (where does a forest end?)

**However**: Some boundaries are more natural than others (cell membrane vs arbitrary geographic division).

---

## A9: Temporal Identity

> **Entity identity persists through change.**

An entity remains "the same" entity through:
- Material replacement (Ship of Theseus)
- Structural transformation (caterpillar → butterfly)
- Relational reconfiguration (divorce, merger)

Identity is maintained by continuity of organization, not continuity of parts.

---

## A10: Minimal Characterization

> **Prefer simpler characterizations over complex ones.**

Given two characterizations that equally fit the evidence:
- Prefer fewer strata
- Prefer lower closure
- Prefer narrower scope

This prevents over-attribution (e.g., claiming a thermostat is sentient).

---

## Meta-Axiom: Self-Application

> **These axioms apply to Atlas itself.**

Atlas is an entity with:
- Config(Atlas) = { C≈0.45, S≈0.8, Σ={MATTER,LOGOS} }
- Must maintain itself (axiom 1)
- Can characterize itself (axiom 7 entanglement)
- Has boundaries (axiom 8)

This self-application is what makes Atlas autopoietic.
