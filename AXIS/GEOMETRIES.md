# AXIS: The Six Geometries

**Status: FROZEN**

The six geometries are the fundamental operations through which Atlas characterizes any entity.

---

## G1: Distinction (Boundary)

**Question**: Where does E end and not-E begin?

**Operation**: Drawing boundaries that separate inside from outside.

**Formal**: `∂E = { x : x ∈ boundary(E) }`

**Examples**:
- Cell membrane (biological)
- Legal jurisdiction (institutional)
- Self/other (psychological)

---

## G2: Transformation (Process)

**Question**: What processes maintain E?

**Operation**: Identifying flows, cycles, and changes that preserve identity.

**Formal**: `T(E) = { f : f(E_t) → E_{t+1} }`

**Examples**:
- Metabolism (biological)
- Revenue cycles (economic)
- Learning (cognitive)

---

## G3: Inclusion (Hierarchy)

**Question**: What is E part of, and what is part of E?

**Operation**: Mapping nested containment relations.

**Formal**: `E ⊂ E' ⊂ E'' ...` and `e ⊂ E`

**Examples**:
- Organ → organism → ecosystem
- Employee → department → company
- Thought → mind → culture

---

## G4: Connection (Relation)

**Question**: What is E connected to?

**Operation**: Mapping edges, links, dependencies.

**Formal**: `R(E) = { (E, E') : connected(E, E') }`

**Examples**:
- Synaptic connections (neural)
- Trade relationships (economic)
- Friendship networks (social)

---

## G5: Reflexion (Self-Reference)

**Question**: How does E represent itself to itself?

**Operation**: Mapping self-models, meta-cognition, recursion.

**Formal**: `M(E) ⊂ E : M(E) ≈ E`

**Examples**:
- Self-concept (psychological)
- Mission statement (organizational)
- Genome (biological)

---

## G6: Quality (Valuation)

**Question**: What does E value? What is good/bad for E?

**Operation**: Mapping evaluative dimensions, preferences, norms.

**Formal**: `V(E) : States → ℝ`

**Examples**:
- Pleasure/pain (sentient)
- Profit/loss (economic)
- Sacred/profane (religious)

## Invariant

Every entity can be approached through all six geometries. The geometries are orthogonal but interconnected. Together they constitute the complete characterization space.

```
Distinction → what IS E
Transformation → what MAINTAINS E
Inclusion → what CONTAINS E
Connection → what RELATES to E
Reflexion → how E KNOWS itself
Quality → what E VALUES
```
